(Nick POV)

I was suddenly woken by the sound of the alarm going off. My hand moved out from under the blanket and grabbed my phone to shut it off.

“Well... here we go again.” I said while moving out of bed, I quickly moved to the other side of the room and turned the lights on.

I went into the kitchen and started making some breakfast for myself.

I was just about to eat my eggs when my phone suddenly started ringing. “Yes mom I’m awake… and Yes I will go to school today.” I said sounding a little bit annoyed. “Am I becoming that predictable?” came the answer from my mother on the other side. My mouth drew into a small smile while I said “After 3 years… YES!”. My mother chuckled at my responds.

Since 3 years ago she only works the morning shift, so she started calling in to see if I was awake… not that always went to school just about 97% of the time.

After I ate my breakfast I went into the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. My brown hair was pointing into all directions and I had bags under my green eyes. “Well don’t I just look wunderbar.” I sighed while trying to straighten my hair a little.

After that I packed my bag and walked out the front door. “Who knows maybe something exciting is going to happen today… eh who am I kidding.” I said to myself while smiling.

(Celestia POV)

Princess Celestia was enjoying breakfast at her dining table in the private wing of Canterlot Castle, her niece Princess Mi Amore Cadenza or Cadence as she prefers to be called was sitting on the other side of the table.

“Something is off today…” Celestia thought to herself, but she couldn’t place the feeling. “Discord is still imprisoned so it couldn’t possible be him…  right?”

“Auntie are you alright your thoughts seem to be miles away today.” Cadence asked with concern in her voice.

Celestia looked up from her plate and sighed “It’s just a strange feeling Cadence, you don’t have to worry.”

“What do you mean strange feeling… don’t tell me you are in love Auntie?” Cadence said with an excited glint in her eyes.

Celestia chuckled and smiled at her niece ”I can assure you Cadence it is not that, it’s more like I feel something strange is going to happen today.”

Cadence looked thoughtful for a moment and spoke “Well as long as it isn’t something bad it won’t be a big problem right?”

“Right… anyway we should probably get going before the nobles get to antsy” Celestia said with a frown on her face.

(Nick POV)

School went pretty smooth today, nothing out of the ordinary or exciting happened, so I went straight home and hoped that my mother had already cooked something to eat.

I live in a small town with a few thousand citizens a few big stores here and there.
My name is Nick Gavins and I am seventeen years old, I visit the only High School in town.

My mother originally lived in Austria until she moved to the US and met my father.
They hit it off right from the beginning as I understand it… and eventually my older brother Kris came along and me… a few years later.

We often visited my relatives in Austria, so I learned german early on which you might notice in my speech patterns… much to the bane of my english teachers.

And that was my life until I was ten years old and my father died in a car accident. Since then my mother had to start working full time again, and me and my brother had to spend a lot of time with our grandparents on our fathers side.

Two years ago my brother moved out of our comfy house and moved in with his girlfriend. They moved into a decent sized flat near the center of the town.
So now it’s just me, my mother and our dog of course.

I walked down the street where my home is located on and unlocked the door.
As I opened the door I was immediately greeted by a delicious smell coming from the kitchen.

I smiled and walked into the kitchen. My mother looked up from where she was standing and said “Food will be ready in a few minutes Nick.” I looked at her and made a dramatic gasp “But I'm starving!”.

My mother gave me a flat stare graped part of the newspaper on the table crushed into a ball and threw it at my head “Here now eat up.” she said with a strict tone in her voice.

We stared at each other for a few seconds before we burst into laughter. “Fine I guess I can wait a few more minutes.” I said while already walking to my room.

___________________________________________________________________

After we had eaten I went into my room and turned on my laptop and started watching some videos online until my phone started ringing.

I looked up from my laptop and looked at my phone and smiled as I saw the name of my best friend on the phone. “Hey what’s up?” I said after accepting the call. “Nothing much, I just wanted to ask if you’d like to meet up today.” came the reply from the other end. “ Sure your place or mine?” I asked. “My place.” came the quick reply. “ Be right there” I said before hanging up.

I turned off my laptop and walked across and graped the laptop bag that was lying next to my bed and stored my laptop inside it.

I walked out of my room told my mother were I was going and made my way to the door. I frowned as I looked out the floor window and saw dark clouds all over the sky. I grabbed an umbrella and went on my way.

As I was walking down a street on the way to my friends house I saw a toy store with a bunch of My little Pony toys on the display window and smiled.

"Ahh the show so many boys myself included watch… but deny the hell out of it when asked about it" I thought to myself while walking by.

A few minutes later it had started to rain so I had opened my umbrella. I stopped at a crosswalk which was placed across a busy street and was regulated by a traffic light. A child a girl was standing behind me her mother was talking to another woman a few feet away.

The traffic light turned green, I quickly looked left and saw only a truck a long enough distance away and on the cars on the right had stopped to let us pass. I started walking to the other side.

I was almost on the other side when I heard a scream. I whipped around and saw the girl frozen in place and the truck coming her way not slowing down. Without thinking I started running and pushed the girl to the side right before the truck hit us both So only I was hit.

My sight went blank and at first I was drowning in intense pain until suddenly I saw a bright light and the pain slowly started to drain away. I heard a calm female voice speaking before I blacked out “Don’t worry everything will be alright.”

(Celestia POV)

Celestia was sitting on throne and made a deep sigh, she had just finished up court for today and it was one of those days were it was just one noble with a stupid or selfish idea after another with only one or two good ideas in between.

She made her way down the corridors to the private wing of her palace and opened the door to the dining hall. A smile formed on her face when she noticed the ponies inside.

Her most faithful student Twilight Sparkle her assistant Spike and her niece Cadence were sitting by the dining table and talked to each other.“Oh Princess good afternoon.” Twilight said in a polite tone as she saw her.

“Good afternoon to you to Twilight, what brings you to me today?” Celestia said with a warm smile on her face. ”Oh I just finished the report you wanted me to write and I wanted to give it to you Princess.”

“Twilight I gave the assignment only yesterday… and it isn’t due until another week, have you even slept since yesterday?” Celestia asked in a concerned and motherly tone.

“Ah, eh he he…. of course I have slept Princess Celestia.” Twilight said sheepishly. Celestia looked over to Spike who just silently shook his head. “Have you at least eaten something.” Celestia asked. “Yes of course… No I kinda forgot about it.” Twilight replied.

Celestia was about to reply when they were suddenly interrupted by a loud fizzling sound. “ What is that?” Cadence asked. The fizzling sound became louder. “It’s coming from that direction.” Spike said in a scared voice.

They followed the sound down to a chamber. As Celestia saw the chamber where the sound came from her heart became heavy with regret “The mirror” she thought to herself.

They opened the door and entered. The surface of the mirror was wobbling uncontrollably and small flashes of lightning shot out from it. “Princess what’s going on?” Twilight asked in a fearful tone.

Celestia was about to answer but was cut off when something was thrown out of the mirror and slided into their direction. She picked it up and looked at it “Is… is that a bag?” Cadence asked from her side.

“I… I guess” Celestia replied. Twilight just looked incredulous at the still flashing and wobbling mirror. She was about to say something as there was a sudden thunderous sound and a figure was thrown out of the mirror.

The figure was thrown a few feet away and didn’t get up. Celestia examined the figure. She could only see the figure from the back but she could tell from his statue that it was a stallion. His fur was a dark shade of cadet blue and his wings were outstretched and covered his head but from what she could tell his mane was brown. She could also tell that he seemed to be around Twilights age.

She was thrown out of her thoughts by the sound of a groan coming from the stallion on the ground. Celestia had to make a sharp intake as he moved his head out from under his wing and revealed a horn on his forehead.

“Has anyone seen the license plate of the truck that hit me because I’m gonna sue that son of a… .” he passed out again before he could finish his sentence.
