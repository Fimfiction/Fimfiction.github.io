Her eyes were closed in peaceful bliss. Her breathing was steady and even. Her heart was light. Suddenly, sweat broke out on her brow. Her breathing became irregular her eyelids fluttered, and then scrunched up. Her scream echoed through the castle. "Sister!" she cried desperately, even as she slept. She opened her eyes to see a radiant light, blinding her. And suddenly it was gone. Celestia smiled at her.

"More nightmares, Luna?" she asked, calm as a summer breeze. Luna balefully nodded, sighing with the exhaustion of a farm worker who was new on the job. She shook out her wings and began to straighten the feathers, grasping them in her teeth and tugging. After all her feathers were in place she stood up. 

"I'll be fine now, sister," she told Celestia, "you should rest for the dawn." Princess Celestia looked worried. She glanced around fearfully, and then leant towards Luna as if she was telling a secret.

"It wasn't a-a vision, was it, Luna?" she whispered through clenched teeth. The Princess of the Night looked surprised. 

"You know I would tell you if I even suspected it!' she softly chided her sister, hurt that her sister would think this. She turned away stubbornly. A cold, metallic touch on her shoulder grasped her attention. She turned to Tia reluctantly. Celestia was smiling. Smiling!

"I have a plan, you see, sister." Celestia's smile widened until she looked maniacal. "Listen..." She leaned in to whisper in Luna's ear. "See, this is what we do." Luna smiled too. This would be fun.
