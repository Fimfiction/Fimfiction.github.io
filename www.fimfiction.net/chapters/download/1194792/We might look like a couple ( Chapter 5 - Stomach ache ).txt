The final chapter of "We might look like a couple."
Stomach ache
Written by Yumyums23

As Gummy walked out of the door he spotted the yummy snacks. He started speed walking towards them, completely forgetting about Ponkie Pie.

He made friends with some other animals in the building, and he ate until his stomach hurt so much he thought he was on fire.

His friend, Mr. Rat abandoned him right when he fell over from the pain. Then, he remembered his owner and her little fall in the bathroom.

He cried and cried but nobody would listen to him.

"I think Gummy's crying" a nearby mare mentioned, scratching her chin, "You think we should ask what's wrong?"

"Nah." Her sister replied, "He's probably just angry that there are not enough snacks for his gigantic belly."

The first mare decided that they would not check on him, that was a mistake.

As they walked away from the sobbing alligator, they failed to notice the blood leaking out from underneath the bathroom door.
