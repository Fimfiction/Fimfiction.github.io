There she was, walking down the long, cold, and wet corridors of the changeling hive. She had a tall and skinny figure. She was dark gray with a line of green running down her back. She had turquoise hair and green eyes, but what was most terrifying about her was probably the random holes she had on her hooves, and on her horn. Her wings were that of an insect. It was the infamous, all powerful, and feared, Queen Chrysalis.

"My Queen!" "My Queen!" A smaller Changeling called out to Chrysalis, trying to get her attention. He was not as scary looking as Chrysalis, he was a lot smaller, but was still a changeling.

"What is it." Chrysalis turned her frustrated head and responded in a terrifying tone, which made the changeling back away a bit.

"Uhhhh, ohhh, I just came to say, he's awake my Queen." He responded with fear, which made Chrysalis smile, but her smile was mostly due to another topic.

"Finally!" "It certainly took him long enough, prepare him for my arrival." Chrysalis raised her hoof as any dictator would due to there servants.

"Yes my Queen." The changeling wasted no time and turned the opposite direction and dashed off too his destination. He kept running and running down the long corridors of the changeling hive, passing by dozens of rooms. Some of theses rooms had ponies trapped inside. They were tied up to the walls and tortured, beaten to a pulp, some of them were being attacked, brutally. The changelings did need live victims to feed on their love, and that is of course what a changeling's diet mostly consists of.

The changeling kept running though. He wasted no time, because he knew of Chrysalis' plan, and could make no mistake in his part of it. He kept running, down long uneven staircases which made him trip, but it only took him one second to get up and keep going. He had finally reached his destination, with Chrysalis only five minutes behind. And what was his destination you might ask? Well it was a prison cell. 

It had a bed with a pillow and a mattress, a sink with a mirror and a bench (not bad for a considered "prison cell"). A small lantern the hung from the ceiling of the cell illuminated a faint green light, which was just enough to light the room. The cell door was as normal as any other door, but it had a large lock that was magic resistant. There was a unicorn pony laying on the bed, rubbing his own head, he was still unaware of where the hell he was, or why he was there.

The changeling unlocked the cell door and entered to find the helpless unicorn still rubbing his head. "Come on, get over the pain, the Queen is on her way and will be here any second, now, GET UP!" The changeling demanded the stallion in pain to get up and present himself to Chrysalis, but he refused.

The dark stallion pierced a menacing look at the changeling with his fierce red eyes which made the changeling snap.

"How dare you! Treat me like that after what we have done for you! I will personally show you your place here bastard!" The changeling was threatening King Sombra himself. Sombra rose from the bed before the changeling could strike him and with one blow from Sombra, the changeling blasted backward threw the wall and out the other side. The changeling was gasping for air as three of his rib bones were sticking out from his chest. His back left leg was bent the wrong way, and a piece of stone hit his left eye and blood was dripping out from his wounds. 

"Well I can see somepony made himself at home." Chrysalis stood just behind the wounded changeling who was begging for her Queen's help.  Two different changelings then appeared behind her and carried the wounded changeling away for treatment.

Sombra tried his best to maintain an upright posture, but he was still lightheaded, and in pain. "Aagghh, errrrr, eeee!!" Sombra stroked his own head as it felt like needles were pierced into it.

"The pain your experiencing is from the healing spell, without it you would be dead, do not worry the pain will leave in a few hours." Chrysalis walked towards him. She was a little taller than him, but Sombra was way more muscular, and Chrysalis liked that, a lot.

"What happened? Why am I here? I was in the Crystal Empire, and then, I fell." He was trying so hard to remember what happened, but could only make out faint images from his brain.

Chrysalis smiled and walked closer to Sombra. "Well to make this short, you tricked Luna, and then attacked the Crystal Empire, but when the Crystal heart was restored, it destroyed you, oh and you lost your horn, but we revived you, healed you, gave you a new horn, and a new opportunity, if your interested."

Sombra then remembered, the hole ordeal with Luna, and the Crystal heart. "How long was I out?" Sombra asked in a demanding and rude tone, but Chrysalis responded anyways.

"You were out for a hole day, but the Crystal Empire attack was three days ago." Chrysalis said this then ordered any nearby changelings to leave, she didn't want any being thrown threw walls like the last changeling was. "Oh, and I might also add that the hole world thinks your dead Sombra, just thought you might want to know."

"Really? No pony but you and the other changeling's know I'm alive?" Sombra was actually surprised no pony in Equestria knew he was still alive.

"How do you like your new horn? Does it suit you my king?" Chrysalis' smile widened as she eyed down Sombra.

"Well, I can't say I'm impressed." Sombra looked in the mirror, there were no scares, nothing to prove his body was completely destroyed, but revived again.

"Shut up Sombra. You know if you were a truly smart "King" you would've let me do the attacking, and the planning." Chrysalis moved closer to Sombra until she was only about a foot from his muzzle.

"Oh you think you could've done better Chrysalis? Let us look back when you attacked Canterlot and the royal wedding. Mmmmmmmm, and how well did that go uh?" Sombra puffed his chest, competition was growing in the room.

Chrysalis lifted an eyebrow. "How do you know about Cadance's wedding? I don't see how that is possible, unless you were there of course." Chrysalis' eyebrow rose even more, and Sombra backed down, lowering his head a little.

"Oh come on, don't tell me you know of the wedding because this "I love Luna" thing. Sombra's head lowered even more, as he came to realise that somehow, Chrysalis knew about him and Luna.

"Umm....ehhh....errrr I...I..l don't love her, that's.....that's just a rumor." Sombra REALLY struggling to speak under his embarrassment. 

"Well, I really don't care, but even if you did love her, I got to say Sombra, you have a poor taste in mare's." Chrysalis' evil smile on her face widened.

"Don't give me that bullshit Chrysalis, you were never something to look at, at least to my eyes." Sombra hissed a little, he got a little angry at Chrysalis' sly remark.

The two looked at each other for a minute before Sombra broke the silence. "Why did you save me? You obviously went out of your way to resurrect me and heal me? And earlier you said a new opportunity, what did you mean by that?" Sombra's tone was as serious as ever, he wanted to get to the bottom of this little "game" now.

"Well I have a proposition for you, if your interested." Chrysalis smiled at Sombra, he thought about it for a minute. Something different happened to Sombra then, before he just agreed to do whatever Chrysalis wanted to do with him, he thought of Luna, and the amazing nights he had spent with her. Did he really want to continue on this path? Or was Luna more valuable to him than Chrysalis and her evil plans. He finally spoke out loud, once again breaking the silence.

"I am listening."

It was midnight in Canterlot.  The moon was at it's peak, all the wealthy and poor ponies of the famous city were fast asleep. lovers were snuggling together under their bed covers, the homeless made do with any shelter they could get their hooves on, foals were in bed dreaming of what all children dream of. The only ponies to be seen still awake were they bat pony night guards, guarding the castle so no unexpected crimes decided to be committed under the cover of dark, and of course the princess of the night herself.

Princess Luna was trotting down the hallways of the Canterlot castle. It was dark, and guards ponies were they only ponies out of bed. She had just finished all of her royal duties and was preparing to quit for the night. Her expression was as depressed as ever, she had never felt so defeated. Just when she thought everything was going to be ok, it all turned south for her and the love she shared with the stallion she loved, King Sombra.

She was just in front of her bedroom door when a night guard had approached her rear. "Your highness." The bat pony bowed with respect to her princess.

"What does thou want, we are tired." Luna turned and faced the kneeling guard.

"Forgive me your highness, but her highness princess Celestia request an audience with you immediately in her chambers."

"At this time of night? surely thou most be mistaken." Luna said with a smirk on her face, she was exhausted and did not feel the need to walk all the way to her sisters bedroom at this time of night.

"Forgive me again your highness, but I'm afraid she is insisting." The guard rose from his bowing position but not dared look Luna in the eyes, for even he could fell her pain.

"We are confused, why does our sister wish to speak with us at this hour, ummm?" Luna launched her head forward looking for a name on the bat ponies armor. 

"Night Core your highness, my name is Night Core. I am a private in the Night guard." The guard said this with hesitation and with fear. Princess Luna eyed him down and smiled, she could see the fear in his eyes.

"Do not be afraid Night Core, does thou know why our sister calls for us?" Luna backed away and lifted her head with pride, Night Core rose his body, revealing his Lunar armor to his princess.

"I'm afraid I have no idea your highness, I only know she really wants to speak with you immediately."

"Uhhhh, very well, shall you escort me to Celestia's chambers." Luna walked past Night Core in all her glory. 

"Very well your highness, I shall." Night Core had escorted Luna during the five minute walk to Celestia's bedroom door where they stopped.

"Thou shall stay here Night Core." Luna said to the night guard who immediately stood too attention next to the door, and Luna entered to see Celestia, laying on a pillow in front of a fire. She was reading a book, the book looked unfamiliar to Luna, but Luna didn't really care. She entered and shut the door behind her.

"Sister, is everything ok?" Luna asked Celestia with concern in her voice, usually at this time Celestia would be sound asleep, but for her to request an audience with Luna at midnight? Something was definitely wrong.

"Everything is great actually, for me at least." Celestia stood from where she was laying and walked towards Luna.

'What do you mean Tia?" Luna slightly stepped back from Celestia, she had taken her comment as an insult. Celestia turned the opposite direction and walked toward the side window of her bedroom.

"Luna, stop trying to put this off, what is really bothering you, no lies this time, ok?" Luna then knew that she couldn't put this off anymore. Ever since she lost Sombra, well we can just say it was down hill from there. Celestia actually knew what was wrong, she knew Luna loved Sombra, and she also knows Sombra had feelings for her, but he still carried on his dark path and betrayed Luna, and attacked the Crystal Empire.

Luna sighed heavily, but finally got the strength to speak. "I think you already know the problem, actually I know you know the problem, it's just....well........it's been hard since Sombra.

"Luna it's only been three days since the Crystal empire incident, I know it's hard, I know you two really did feel for each other, but...."

"But what, just because he betrayed me once we had to kill him! He just deserved to die!" Luna cut off Celestia mid sentence, Luna's rude remark made Celestia a little angry.

"Look, Sombra told you he would stop, but he went behind your back and put innocent lives at risk. What if he was victorious?! Would you still love him if he had killed Cadance and Shinning and took the Crystal Empire for himself?" Celestia really raised her voice, she really had some steam that needed to let loose.

"Luna I love you, you're my little sister, you're one of my many responsibilities, I'm sorry killing Sombra broke your heart, I'm truly am, but you must understand why we had to do it." Luna started to tear, she fell to the ground with her hooves over her head.

"Oh Luna, I truly feel sorry for you, but I don't want you to beat yourself over this, and I certainly don't want you to beat other ponies over this, it will be hard, but we will move on, we are the leaders of Equestria, and we must. Do you understand Luna?"

Luna was laying on the ground, sobbing still. Celestia then walked over and sat next to her and stroked her back, she gave her hurt sister the comfort she deserved. 

"Do you understand Luna?" Celestia raised Luna's chin with her front right hoof and wiped the tears from her cheeks. 

"Yeah, I guess I do, I'm so sorry Celestia, I'm sorry for everything." Luna hugged Celestia in a tight embrace, Celestia hugged her sister back.

"Shh it's not your fault Luna, remember, Sombra betrayed you, it will always be on Sombra." 

"Celestia? do you think he will ever come back?" Luna looked towards the ground, still sobbing and hugging Celestia as all sisters would.

"No, I think he's gone for good this time Luna, I'm sorry." 

Celestia supported Luna, giving her the comfort she deserved. She hated to see her this depressed about Sombra, but she also feared of what the future would bring for everypony if Luna kept being this sad, this depressed.

The two alicorn sisters stayed with each other for the remainder of the night. Luna and Celestia would start the next day knowing the conflict would be over, for good.

But they were all deceived.
