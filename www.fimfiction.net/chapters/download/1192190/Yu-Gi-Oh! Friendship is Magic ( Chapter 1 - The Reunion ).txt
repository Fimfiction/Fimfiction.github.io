Twilight was going through her deck she made a few days back. She then placed a card in her deck and then used her magic to place her deck back into a box when Spike suddenly entered the room with a scroll in hand. "Hey, Spike," she said.

"Hey, Twilight," Spike replied. "I got a letter from Cadence."

"Cadence? Let me see, Spike." Twilight levitated the scroll and unrolled it and started to read what it says out loud. "Dear Princess Twilight, I am pleased to announce that you and your friends are invited to a tournament that is being held at at the Crystal Empire. The participants for the tournament will be announced tomorrow. I hope to see you and your friends soon." Twilight looked at Spike. "Spike, let my friends know about the tournament that is coming up."

"Right away, princess." Spike saluted and rushed out of the room while Twilight began to pack some books and her duel disk in her bags.





A unicorn stallion was dueling a random pegasus stallion at Canterlot as the crowd watched them. The unicorn's field was two Blue-Eyes White Dragon and Luster Dragon. He had four cards in his hoof. The pegasus' field was Ancient Gear Golem. He had two cards in his hoof.

???: LP 2000. ???: LP 700.

"My turn," the unicorn said. "Draw!" He then grinned and looked at the pegasus. "I activate Polymerization and fuse my two Blue-Eyes and one in my hand to call forth Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon." The three dragons fused together to form a three headed dragon. [ATK: 4500. Lv. 12] "This duel is over for you. Blue-Eyes, obliterate that Ancient Gear and wipe out his life points!!!" The three dragons opened their mouths and fired a beam at the Golem and destroyed it. The pegasus screamed as his life points were lowered to zero. The crowd cheered for the winner of the duel as the unicorn walked up to the pegasus. They then shook hooves as thanks for the match. "Good game, sir."

"Good game. If I may ask, who are you?"

"Charming Thunder, nephew of Princess Celestia and Princess Luna and brother of Princess Cadence."

The pegasus gasped and said with his head lowered in a bow, "It is an honor to meet you!"

"The honor is all mine. I should get going. I don't want to keep my aunts waiting." The pegasus nodded and flew away as Charming Thunder walked to the direction towards the castle. A pegasus royal guard flew down and walked towards him with a scroll in hoof. "Guard, what a surprise. I was just about to head back to the castle. What news do you bring?"

"A message from your sister," the guard replied as he gave Charming Thunder the scroll. He then used his magic to unroll it and read it to himself. He then looked at the guard. "Thank you." The guard then flew back to the castle as Charming Thunder continued his stroll through town back to the castle.





At the castle, Charming Thunder packed his duel disk and his box containing his deck. He then levitated his bag and placed it on his back. He then noticed Luna walking with a black pegasus. He then approached them and greeted, "Hello, Aunt Luna. Hello, Danny. I take it that you got the invitation to the tournament being held at the Crystal Empire?"

"We did, Charming," Luna said.

"Not to mention that participants will be announced tomorrow morning," Danny added. "If I were in the tournament, I would beat all of my opponents and claim my prize, whatever it is."

"Beats me," Charming Thunder said. "I wonder what the prize is."

"Shall we be off then?" Luna asked. "We don't want to miss our ride to the Crystal Empire."

"Agreed." Charming Thunder then walked with Luna and Danny through the halls of the castle.





Twilight and her friends waited at the train station for their ride to go to the Crystal Empire. "Lets see..." Twilight said as she went through her list in her head. "Duel Disk? Check. Deck? Check. Books on Duel Monsters? Check." Twilight then nodded and saw the train about to arrive.

"OOOOH!!!" Pinkie said. "The train is here!!!" The train pulled in and came to a stop. The doors at each car opened letting the passengers disembark. Once everyone disembarked Twilight and the others showed their tickets and boarded the train. They took their seats and waited for others to board.

"This tournament is going to be awesome!!!" Rainbow said.

"You said it, Rainbow," Applejack said. The train's horn sounded as the doors at each car closed. The train then took its leave from Ponyville.

"This is going to be a long trip," Fluttershy said as she sat back and relaxed on her seat.





That night at the Crystal Empire castle, Cadence went through the preparations for the next day as the crystal ponies set up tables and chairs at each table. She then noticed Charming Thunder entered the room and smiled. "Charming!!!" she said as she rushed over to him to give him a tight hug. "How are you, brother? It's been awhile."

"I am doing well, sis," Charming Thunder said. "How are the preparations?"

"Going well. They are just setting up tables now."

"It is great to see you, Cadence."

"You should get some rest after that long trip you had to get here. In the meantime, I have to see Twilight and the others."

"Twilight? She's invited too?"

"Yes. Along with her friends."

"It has been a while since I have seen Twilight. Will she be arriving soon?"

"If you want to see her, I can let her know that you want to meet her."

"Keep my name a surprise?"

"Of course, brother." 

Flash entered the room and said, "Princess Twilight and her friends have arrived, your highness."

"Good." Cadence then turned to Charming Thunder. "I must go. I was nice to see you again." Cadence took her leave from the room leaving Charming Thunder to help with the preparations.





Twilight was reading her book on Duel Monsters when a knock was heard. She bookmarked her book and closed it then walked towards the door. She then used her magic to open the door and there was Charming Thunder standing at the other side. She gasped and tears began to fall out of her eyes. Twilight then hugged Charming Thunder relieved to see him again from all those years since she was a filly. She then broke the hug and looked at him in the eyes with a smile and wiped off her tears.





Twilight Sparkle



I should have known that you'd be here
I should have known it all along
You were invited for this occasion as well
It has been far too long, my friend
I am relieved to see you now
I am relieved that you are here





Charming Thunder



Oh, Twilight, my dear friend
In that time when I thought you were gone
My dear friend, on that day a few days before you left
Ah, Twilight, you came and found where I hid
Don't you deny that you did
That long ago night





Twilight Sparkle



That night before I left




Charming Thunder nodded and placed a hoof on her shoulder.




Charming Thunder



Once there was a night beneath a moonless sky


Too dark to see a thing, too dark to see each other





Twilight Sparkle



I stole to your side to tell you how I feel
I couldn't see your face but sensed you even so
And I touched you





Charming Thunder



And I felt you





Charming Thunder/Twilight Sparkle



And I heard those ravishing refrains





Twilight Sparkle



Those days when we were kids





Charming Thunder



Those fun times we had





Twilight Sparkle



And I held you





Charming Thunder



And I touched you





Twilight Sparkle



And embraced you





Charming Thunder



And I felt you





Charming Thunder/Twilight Sparkle



And with every breath and every sigh





Twilight Sparkle



I was brave like you





Charming Thunder



I felt no longer shy





Charming Thunder/Twilight Sparkle



At last our feelings bared
Beneath a moonless sky




Charming Thunder and Twilight sat on the bed together.




Twilight Sparkle



And blind in the dark, as soul gazed into soul
I looked into your heart and saw you pure and whole





Charming Thunder



Cloaked under the night with nothing to suppress
A mare and a stallion, no more and yet no less
And I kissed you





Twilight Sparkle



And caressed you





Charming Thunder/Twilight Sparkle



And the world around us fell away
We said things in the dark
We never dared to say





Charming Thunder



And I caught you





Twilight Sparkle



And I kissed you





Charming Thunder



And I took you





Twilight Sparkle



And I was brave





Charming Thunder/Twilight Sparkle



With a need too urgent to deny
And nothing mattered then
Except for you and I
Again and then again
Beneath a moonless sky




Charming Thunder looked away then got up to walk to the window.




Charming Thunder



And when the day finally came with the sun risen in the sky
Ashamed with the news given to me, afraid to see your eyes
I stood while you left and whispered a goodbye
And slipped into the dark beneath a moonless sky




Twilight got up and rushed to Charming Thunder’s side.




Twilight Sparkle



And I loved you
Yes, I loved you
I'd have followed anywhere you led
I tried to swear my love
But found you gone instead





Charming Thunder



And I loved you





Twilight Sparkle



How I loved you





Charming Thunder



And you left me





Twilight Sparkle



And I still loved you





Charming Thunder



And you had to both of us know why





Twilight Sparkle



We both knew why





Charming Thunder/Twilight Sparkle



And yet I won't regret
From now until I die
The night I can't forget
Beneath a moonless sky


Charming Thunder and Twilight’s foreheads touched as they held hooves. “And now,” Charming Thunder said. “Here we are. Together again. You must tell me all about your adventures with your friends. And this student you once had.”

“I’ll introduce you to them tomorrow morning,” Twilight said before she yawned. “For now I am exhausted from the ride to the Crystal Empire.”

“Of course, your highness.” Charming Thunder bowed and began to take his leave.

“Charming.” Charming Thunder stopped at the sound of Twilight’s voice and turned to look at her. “It is good to see you again.” Charming Thunder smiled and left the room as he closed the door behind him with his magic.
