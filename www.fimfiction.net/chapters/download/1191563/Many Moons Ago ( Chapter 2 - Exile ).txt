She remembered time on the moon, waiting for revenge. Oh, how clearly she remembered!

She'd paced along it's surface, snarling muttered curses at the land below. She'd drawn violent scenes where Celestia was hated. The darkness had been too great.

But now, even with it gone, she could not look at her reflection without wincing at Nightmare Moon's treacherous eyes, her fangs and bloodthirsty posture. Could she ever let go?





Luna gingerly levitated her luggage into the baggage car of the train. "Twilight Sparkle will be waiting," her sister had said. Well, she trusted her sister and Twi had stopped the nightmare, but she didn't even know the pony! Not properly! Why had she agreed to this ridiculous idea.

"Uh... Princess?" a guard asked. "The-the trains about to leave..." He trailed off, seemingly terrified. Luna cringed. They still saw her as Nightmare Moon. Well, after everything, why shouldn't they?

That didn't make it hurt less.

She leaped into a carriage just as the whistle blew, only to be bombarded with fear from the other ponies. She crept into the baggage car and stayed there, silent tears streaming down her face.
