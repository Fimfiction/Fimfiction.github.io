Chapter four of "We might look like a couple."
Poonkie pie feels threatened (for some reason)
Written by Yumyums23

Pellet poo felt very offended, but she did not know why.

"I know why, you keep spelling my name wrong!" Pinky perplex screamed. She stood inside of her bathroom, angry that Fluttershy and Twilight left her party. 

And that the heart of the party, Discord, left as well. She sat on the toilet, the seat down, of course, thinking about her situation.

"What can I do to save this party?" the pink pony asked herself. 

At the end she decided to just sleep in the bathtub, deciding that the party could be better when out of her hands. She looked next to her as she tried to go to sleep and saw Gummy staring at her.

"Why are you just giving up like this Pinkie Pie?" he asked the pony, "That isn't the Pinkie Pie I know."

But of course, he wasn't actually using his mouth to talk. Gummy said all of that just using body language.

"Your right Gummy." Pookie Pie said, jumping out of the bathtub.

Sadly, as she jumped out she tripped on the side of the bathtub and hit her head super hard on the ground.

Gummy poked her.

She didn't respond.

"I said all of that encouraging stuff for nothing..." Gummy thought angrily to himself. He then walked out the door, hoping he could get someones attention.
