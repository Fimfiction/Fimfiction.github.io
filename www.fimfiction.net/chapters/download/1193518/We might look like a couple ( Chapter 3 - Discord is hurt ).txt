Chapter three of "We might look like a couple."
Discord is hurt
Written by Yumyums23

Discord paced back and forth in his home of many stairs, wondering why he said he would turn evil. 

He knew he would never have the guts to actually betray Fluttershy...

Even though he had before.

Tears ran down his face as he fell to the floor, not having any motivation to stand.

Not even cotton candy could make him happy right now.

Not even dogs licking peanut butter.

Not even Twilight running away from a flying quesadilla...

All that would make him happy right now, is seeing his Fluttershy.

But he couldn't, not after what he had said.
