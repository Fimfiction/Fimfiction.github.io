Chapter two of "We might look like a couple."
Fluttershy is not happy
Written by Yumyums23

Twilight and Fluttershy decided to go on a date but to do it as friends.

They walked back into town and into Twilight's rock candy castle to plan the date.

They ran inside and found the entire town throwing a party for them.

"Welcome to the party for you and Flutters becoming lovers!" Pinkie poo yelled, catching the purple lavender unicorn by surprise.

"No no no." Fluttershy squeaked as loud as she could. (which wasn't that loud, but still) "Me and Twilight Jenkins Butterbutt Sparkle are not a couple!"

The crowd did not listen though.

Discord then appeared out of nowhere and made the most annoying announcement, or at least to Twilight it was annoying.

"I have decided to be evil again!" he yelled in a voice that just made the unicorn want to spit. "If Fluttershy won't stay loyal to me, I guess I have to!"

The butter coated mare yelped in surprise and ran up to him.

"Discord no!" She screamed "Twilight and I are not together, you and I are!"

She then realized that he was gone off into the sunset, eating his butt flavored tootsie rolls.

The butter slice crawled up into a ball and cried because she did not know what else to do.

"I got an idea!" Twilight yelled from behind her. "How about we kiss?"

"NO!" Fluttershy yelled in an almost demonic voice "We are NOT a couple, so we shall NOT kiss!"

Twilight had tears in her eyes as she walked up to Fluttershy...

And she took off a costume, revealing that she was not Twilight, but a pig with wings.'

Fluttershy screamed as loud as she could, hoping she could get out of this nightmare, but sadly it was not a dream.

Princess Luna then walked up to them and shoved some roses in their faces.

"Who's the happy couple?"
