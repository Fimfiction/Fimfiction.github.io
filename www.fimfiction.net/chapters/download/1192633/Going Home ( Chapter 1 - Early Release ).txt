The tentacled being known as Ach'rd'oa shifted in her cell, shifting in her bindings she attempted to return to her slumber, but that which awoke her continued.

"Those Damn Ponies, When I escape again..." 

"You'll What?"  Ach'rd'oa shouted.

She rose from her bed and stalked to edge of her bindings, her tall, lithe frame shaking in rage.  Again she bellowed at the cell next to her.

"The always win, the Ponies always win!!!!!  What will happen is you will break free and then be sent back here or destroyed.  Sombra, You, The Storm King, Me, hell, they reformed Discord.  So, Tirek, do us all a favor and shut the fuck up!!!!!!  You stupid spoiled little child.  Oh, my brother and father betrayed me, blech.  Truth is you are a mad dog that no one has had the kindness to put out of it's misery.  Because for some Idiotic reason the Ponies think any one can be redeemed." 

Retreating back to her bed she sat, bringing her clawed hands to her head, she tried to fight the oncoming migraine.  Unable to stop the words, she continued.

"I have lost my entire race, which is not the same as destroying it, you pompous shit!  I had loved ones, compatriots.  Those that I cared for and protected.  All of them gone and I am the last.  I am the last because I can birth no more of my kind.  The rest were exterminated to a one because we wouldn't play nice with the ponies, because we treated them like just another lesser race.  We used them for labor, pleasure, and food, just like all the others The Illithids encountered.  What do the Ponies do?  They send Celestia and Luna, who upon seeing our city and all we have wrought, destroy our entire civilization in one night.  I tried to organize those that where left, those that could flee.  But they hunted us all down and when I was the last they caught me.  They discovered that I had not the capability to spawn more of my kind and locked me down here.  So that in time I would see the error of my ways."

"So, what?  I am supposed to give friendship a try, give into their disgusting ways?"  Tireck Growled.

"No Dipshit, You're supposed to shut up and let the rest of us deal with our misery in PEACE!!!!!  I no longer have any wish to conquer, nor do I have a wish to go and make friends.  I would however, like to sit in my mother's chair, to walk the streets of the dreaming city once more.  To see the remains of the birthing pool where my brothers emerged.  To just once, before I sink into the dreamless sleep of my kind breathe of the night air, not whatever it is we get down here.  I wish to go home."  Ach'rd'oa hung her head and silence reigned, Tireck at last silenced.

A click was heard, loud in the silence, wards deactivating, one after another, the chains that peirced her flesh turning to dust.  Healing energy flowed into her, closing the wounds that she had accumulated over her long imprisonment.  Gasping for air she looked to the door as it easily swung open.  She rose and walked out the door.

Celestia and Luna sat at breakfast.  Luna tired after a long night and Celestia readying herself for the labors of the day.  A Red flash of light momentarily blind the sisters and, as they opened her eyes they beheld a letter upon the table.  It was written in blood and was upon a parchment made of skin, both Princesses stared at each other.  Taking it in her magic, Luna began to read aloud.

To Princess Celesia, Princess of the Sun, Lady of the Day
To Princess Luna, Princess of The Moon, Lady of the Night
To Princess Twilight, Princess of Friendship, Lady of Ponyville

"This is to certify on this day Tuesday of 3500 ANM in the month of January, on the 8th day that prisoner# 00023, named Ach'rd"oa, has been deemed worthy of parole, as she is no longer a threat to any of the free thinking and free willed beings of Equestria and is subject to the rights, privileges, and responsibilities therein, both lawful and implied.  She is to be allowed passage back to the Dreaming City, known as Ry'll'Ch where ownership of such is to be returned to her.  What she does next will determine her future for fair or foul.  Let all be blessed upon hearing these words and rejoice that one that has been lost for so long has begun to find their way.
Your Servant Unceasing,
Tarturus"

Finishing the letter, Luna asked.  "Did you know that Tarturus could...." 

"No Sister, I did'nt"  Came Celestia's reply.

"Oh, Ach'rd'oa is an Illithid correct?"

"Half Illithid, sister, she cannot produce more like her."

"Ah, So how are we to deal with this?"

"We sit and wait, if she is indeed no longer a threat then we leave her be."

"And If not?"

"Then, younger sister mine, we will find out what barbecued Callamari tastes like."

The two sisters lapsed back into a comfortable silence.  The breakfast forgotten, each to their own thoughts and preperations.  In the end they bid each other farewell and Luna went to rest as Celestia went to begin the day.
In their haste, both failed to ask one thing, WWPTSD?

Ach'rd'oa left the cavern that she had been lead to and walked out into the sunlight, before sat her home, a vast sprawling ruin, the doors sealed to prevent entry.  She walked forward and touched a clawed hand where the doors meet and one by one the doors swung open.  Feeling the City awaken, she smiled for the first time in over a century, the warmth of Ry'll'ch's greeting filling her with joy

"It is good to be home, now to work, to task."

Once more she entered into the city of her birth as the Doors closed behind her, she was free.
