Groggily raising her head, Twilight crawled her way from the tangled mess of blankets her bed had become. Slinking down the stairs, she followed the smell of beautiful nectar that was her morning cup of coffee. Staggering blindly into the kitchen, she kissed Rainbow dash, poured herself a cup of the black viscous tar that was her special blend, drank the cup like a shot glass, poured herself another cup.  Then, glancing around her kitchen she spotted her friends, waking fully she smiled. 

“Hey guys, what’s up?”  Twilight smiled at her friends, "And why is Rainbow on the floor?"

“Y’all kissed Dash again.”

“What?  No I didn’t.”  Then she continued thoughtfully, "I've never kissed Rainbow Dash, no matter what my Romantic Fanfiction says."

"What was that?" Applejack asked

"Huh? Nothing."  Twilight replied.

Her friends just shook their heads at Twilight, Rainbow still recovering her powers of thought from the Alicorn powered kiss she had just received. 

“Not that I’m not glad to see you girls, but why are you six here?”  Twilight asked, a thoughtful look appeared on her face, 

“This isn’t another intervention is it?”

Spike spoke up first, “No, we all wanted to know about the ancient city in the Everfree that suddenly appeared over night.  We thought you might have some ideas.”

"Yeah! I have to know if I have a Congratulations on reawakening your Blasphemous City of Terror party to plan and what insanity inducing aberration of reality it's for.  I mean do you know what'll happen if I use the oysters meant for Cthullu if the party wa meant for Yog-Soth, not to mention what a drama queen Nylarhotep can be if something goes wrong.  I mean, honestly Twilight, a little notification would have been nice." Pinkie interjected.

“City what city?  Listen if this is about my coffee consumption, I have it down to three pots a day, which we all agreed was acceptable for an Alicorn of my age and body weight.”

“Quite Darling, even though you did work out how to triple the potency in each pot, making your personal brew the equivalent of sludge, but again, not why we are here. Like dear Spikey Wikey said, a city revealed itself after you had passed out from your five day book binge. We wanted to know if you'd heard anything from the Princesses about this.”

“No, I’m pretty sure they would have notified me of that.”  The Purple Princess got another thoughtful look, “So this intervention is about my book bingeing, huh?  Well I'll have you know I made sure to feed Owlicious and gave Spike access to the grocery money.  Also I wore the horn inhibitor with the 5 digit randomized code lock so that I wouldn’t cast anything without being able to mathematically calculate the exact sequence of randomization.”

“Owlicious is over at my house and the grocery money only had 5 bits in it.  Spike stayed with Rarity after the second day.” Fluttershy interjected.  “But we really are telling the truth about the city.  I found out about it when a manticore that had lived there was complaining about getting evicted.  Oh, and if you don't mind that is, can you send Phil back home?"

Twilight looked confused, "Phil?"

Her friends nodded eerily in unison, then said simultaneously, in the same deep voice, "Yeah, if you wouldn't mind, in this dimension I can only exist in the minds of these six mares and this young drake.  But if it will help move things along, a letter did come for you, from a Mr. Tartarus.  I had Spike place it on your desk, I didn't want to interrupt your obsessive spree of Insanity.  So, not that this is not fun and all, but I really would like to get back to my own family.  So can you just banish me and let us all exit this bad gag that has run to long."

Twilight pursed her lips, "Fine, Klaatu, Barada, Necktie,"  She intoned

"Yeah, you seem to have gotten the last one wrong."  Phil replied.

Twilight took another sip of her coffee, clearing her throat she said, in a slow, calm, quiet voice. "If you do not leave my friend's minds this very instant, then retreat back to wherever it is I called you from, I will yank your essence out of them and feed said essence through my coffee maker to add extra kick to the next pot."

Twilight watched as smoke poured out of her friends and fled screaming up the stairs towards whatever circle she had called 'Phil' out of, a moment later she felt the surge of an interdemensional gateway opening and shutting extremely quickly.

Twilight smiled, "Still got it."

She then picked up her coffee cup, kissed Rainbow Dash, again, poured herself another cup and retreated to her desk.  Quickly reading the letter she yelled to her still rising friends.  "Hey guys, I found our next Friendship Adventure."

Running over to them, she waited as they got to there feet, then noticed that one of her friends was still on the floor.

"Hey, Guys?  What happened to Rainbow Dash?"

The Purple Book horse was puzzled that all her friends, minus Rainbow, face palmed in unison.

Back in Cantorlot, Princess Celestia, sat tending to the day court.  All throughout her duties she felt like she had forgotten something.  The Noble before her was twattling on about some inane thing she was going to politely say no to, completely unaware that his Princess wasn't paying him the slightest bit of attention.

"What am I missing?"  Celestia thought.  "It's such a horrible feeling not to remember.  Let me retrace my steps, I woke up, raised the sun, Luna set the moon.  We retreated to breakfast.  Tartarus sent us a letter, hmmmmm.  Something about that letter.  Something I am forgetting, Hmmmmmmm."

A clamoring was heard at the Day Court door, and in rushed Luna, still in her Pajamas, her panicked look evident upon her face.  "Sister, there was another name on that letter!" 

The Princess of the Day, paused, why would there be another name on the letter?  Cadance was a princess of a lesser kingdom, so it wouldn't have been addressed to her.  In fact the only Princess that might have gotten...... the......... letter...... was... "HOLY FUCK SHIT CRAP SUCK.  PRINCESS TWILIGHT SPARKLE GOT THE SAME LETTER!!!!!"
