> Prologue: The Living Error
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

We all gathered in the living room of our government funded house
"How long has it been acting like this?"
I was referring to Ja'mari's Dimensional Knife A.K.A. The D-Knife. " I don't know! It won't stop glowing red!". He wasn't wrong, we casted every magic spell in the book Literally. Not even Serena's invulnerability to heat would allow her to hold it. 
"Well it's quite obvious that it's immune to magic which you should've figures out by the first, i don't know, TWENTY SPELLS!?!?" Wisp scolded " That was a waste of perfectly good Magic!". Even yelling sounded quiet in his low voice which is why i nicknamed him Wisp. " Well I'm sorry I don't everything about Magic!" I retorted. Suddenly a peaceful tune filled the air. As we were all calmed down Emma snapped her fingers turning off the music as abrupt as it began. 
" Guys! Guys! We're getting nowhere!" She yelled " Ja'mari have you tried dimension-hopping yet?". "well no" he replied "i thought the Knife might blow up or something."

"OK,well try." 

Ja'mari began to focus his energy unto the blade as it began to glow a bright light blue, until he stabbed into the air an audible ripping sound  being heard as he did so. As he cut the rip deeper a portal opened revealing a different dimension none of us have seen before. "Whoa" Serena said breathlessly as we stared out unto the meteor-like surface, a night sky above it. strangely enough we weren't being sucked in so i guess it just looks like space. i noticed the "stars" were awfully large. "Lady's first" Ja'mari gestured towards the portal nervously 
"Coward" Serena commented pushing him aside as we all went through the portal to investigate. 
********************************************************************************************************
As the portal closed behind us, i noticed the 'stars' had different symbols on them. One had seven multicolored hearts on it while a second one had different symbols on them, one of them being a six pointed star. "Okay this is new" i commented looking around at the strange landscape before us.
My eye flashed yellow and on full instinct summoned my ax in order to deflect a bone that would've impaled me had i not reacted in time. Wait a bone...? a small gasp coming from Emma alerted me to the strange figure before us mostly staring at me. Assuming their staring came from me deflecting their attack I activated my yellow eye in order to analyze him better
ERROR_SANS ATK 10 DEF 10
A living Error whose sole purpose is to destroy AUs
I could see why he was called Error he reminded me of a skeleton except with barely any detail on his clothes, completely black with the exception of a red shirt underneath his jacket his right eye is a small yellow dot and his left eye is blue with a ring of yellow on the outside.He appeared to me eternally crying. i couldn't help but notice that the two 'stars' were wrapped in blue stings, strings that end at Error's hands.
"Who are you?" Wisp asked what we were all thinking.
Error stopped staring at me at looked at Wisp
"people call me Error, well those who meet me and live to tell the tale."
suddenly, bones sprang up from where Wisp was standing. luckily he used his Ninja arts to reappear right behind him in hopes of incapacitating him.......
Only to be blasted by a strange animal resembling yellow skull. As he struggled to get up i could hear a strange and corrupted song begin to play and now i realized this Error was trying to kill us! "Guys! This guy is hostile!"."ya think!?!?" Wisp called out as he was being wrapped up in blue wires. "CHARGE!" i called out.
only to be met with a Thrown Wisp hurtling at us. dodging in the nick of the time i watched as my teammate were knocke down and surrounding them in a bone cage. " you seem to be the strongest" The Error commented "LeT'S FiX tHat ShaLl wE?" blue wires began to rush forward at me, only to be deflected by a slash from my ax. "Pk Thunder β!" I called out as two Thunder bolts came crashing down as Error nonchalantly side-stepped dodging each attack " did you think i was  going to stand there and-" 
-50
Error 6,950/7,000
Multiple error signs appeared around Error as he stared at the yellow spear lodged into his foot
"Not bad, you hit me, that WON'T repeat"
I quickly got over the shock of how high his HP was and summoned my ax as i rushed for forward and dodged a "Glitch Blaster" as i decided to start calling it. "Same Here!" i called out as a ball of energy began to form in my hand
"Pk Charge Beam β!"
A blast of electric energy blasted out as it was easily countered and overpowered by another Glitch blaster which scored a direct hit blasting the living crap out of me
-40
Justin 10/50
"D-dang it....." I murmured What is this thing.  Maybe just maybe....... i could try and reason with it. "Why are you doing this!" i called out. Error flinched and stopped attacking "you don't know?". i stared at him in a way that would answer his question. He  glared at me and said "your world is an AU and i'm here to stop it before it can begin!"  he called out " if i crash these dimensions together i will successfully destroy this timeline!"
AU.......?
"But why?" i replied  trying not to look tired.
" Because. Your World. Is. An. Anomaly!" He cried out and pulled the string wrapped around the two glowing orbs in the sky pulling them into each other...........
No.
Not yet
NOT EVER
"PK HOPE γ!"
An explosion made of light blew right in front of Error sending him flying as he began to glitch horrendously
-4,000
 Error 2,950/7,000
............but not before the dimensions crashed into each other causing a bright light to appear.
No........ I-I Failed........ The light began to grow brighter and brighter by the second
I looked towards my now freed friends staring at me......
"Guys...." I looked at each and everyone's faces one last final time "It was a honor to fight by your sides."
The light became brighter than any light on Earth my HOPE growing in my SOUL just as bright as the light.
Game over i thought to myself as the light enveloped everything making impossible to see























Justin.......



























Wake up..................

Author's Note
My first story so criticism is welcome

Wake up Justin....................




"Gah!" 
"Ugh..... what happened?"
I quickly noticed I was lying down and sat up. It was just a dream?. i looked around and saw that there was nothing but a large monitor in a cube shaped room made of.........tinted window? "am I dead?" I wondered "If am.... is this limbo?"
I didn't  really think that purgatory or limbo was real I just thought you either went to heaven or the inferno. i walked up to the monitor and noticed there was a weird set of symbols.

✌︎⬥︎♋︎♓︎⧫︎♓︎■︎♑︎ ♓︎■︎◻︎◆︎⧫︎📬︎📬︎📬︎

What......?
i noticed there was a key board that had two buttons next to it

🕈︎♓︎■︎♑︎ ♎︎♓︎■︎♑︎⬧︎

☜︎■︎♑︎●︎♓︎⬧︎♒︎

seeing as how the first button was lit i pushed the second one. The screen flashed before the symbols became English.
AWAITING INPUT...
OK that was fixed now what? i noticed another button on my right that read BROWSE. as i pushed it my lonely slowly began.
********************************************************************************************************

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH *CRASH*
I quickly dusted myself off as i checked the wall.
Nothing.
I'm making zero progress..... I've been stuck here for MONTHS with the only thing to do is to watch the monitor or just try to damage the walls. Well that and watch Pinkie Pie do her thing. Pinkie is a pink pony with poofy  magenta hair and pink fur with a tattoo called a "cutie mark" that had two blue balloons and a yellow one.  she was always energetic and i always laugh as she somehow breaks the laws of physics and bounce everywhere without any exhaustion. The monitor allowed me to be a creep and spy on ponies, monsters, and that FRIGGING ERROR who was reformed. that was something i loved about this world. When a bad guy showed up, you either blast them with friendship rainbows or befriend them and they become a HUGE help to society. Sometimes, they would help save the world. 
friendship......
tears began to well up in my eyes. My friends, i-i miss them..... so much........ I miss my family, i miss sleeping..... I miss EATING. this broken reality of mine made it so i didn't nee food or sleep. I want it back, I'll give ANYTHING to hug my little brother again......
in order to stop myself from going insane, i memorized the name of every person in this world, and I mean EVERY NAME. the Mane 6, Frisk, The princesses, etc. i also memorized how to speak in wingdings, and speaking of which i think Dr.  Gaster somehow knows I exist. He keeps looking in the direction of the "cameras", it's spooky. Discord acts the same way, which makes sense since he also been able to see a invisible human that no one else but Gaster and himself. 
being alone for so long allowed something inside to wake up inside me, causing me to faint as it takes over my body and trashes everything but the monitor. he talks to me sometimes and i wonder if i have a split personality-
"It's rude to talk about me like that."
	"Whatever, i do what I want  besides, it doesn't matter we're stuck here with no way out". Anyways I watched the Ponies and Monsters, which now that i think about it they must've come from dimensions that Error combined, as they had their adventures and their fights. Does it make me  a stalker if i have a huge crush on one of the Mane 6? (It's Fluttershy) I don't know but without any friends you get REALLY lonely. "i don't think i'll ever get out."
"are you sure about that?" I eeped as i threw a yellow spear at the voice which they tried to block with a green shield that came from a bony hand... only for it to break as the spear stopped a literal inch from his face "impressive" said the Doctor. "I-i-i'm so sorry Doc i just...." 
"No it's fine" the Doctor interrupted flicking the spear away " I shouldn't have scared you." he walked forward handing me a page from a spell book written in wing dings "and i think i can help you." I took the page reading it as he mentioned, "it's called a-"
"Reality Shatter, I know how to read this font, isn't this spell uncastable?" i asked motioning to some of the wingdings at the middle of the page. 
"Well yes normally it would" he replied " but with Twilight's help we figured someone like you could cast seeing as you meet the criteria" Of course, Twilight Sparkle was as big as an egghead as I am when it came to magic. The Criteria was 1. you had to be outside of reality (ironically) and 2. you had to be a human with a ridiculously large amount of magic energy in your SOUL. I quickly perked up "You mean i can go home with this?" i asked. Sadly, the doctor shook is head. 
"i'm afraid not but at least you'll be out of here" he said gesturing toward the empty space we were in. Sigh....."Okay let's do it" The Doctor teleported away as he knew how dangerous this spell was. 
"Here goes nothing" after all, I've tried everything else, can't get any worse.

I took a deep breath as my SOUL appeared in front of me.

"⚐︎❍︎♋︎♏︎ ⬥︎♋︎ ❍︎□︎◆︎ ⬧︎♒︎♓︎■︎♎︎♏︎♓︎❒︎◆︎"

I grabbed my SOUL and threw at the wall...

....And huge cracks appeared signalling to me that the spell had worked!
Well i'm not going home I thought but i'm going somewhere better......

A white heart floated down from the sky, glowing faintly as it landed near the Castle of The Two Sisters.  It landed on the ground eventually taking the shape of a Earth pony with white fur, gray eyes, and Black hair with a white streak in his hair and tail. 
"Where..... Where am I?" 
(Switching to Twilight's POV)
"Do we really have to go in there again?" Fluttershy nervously asked she was referring to the Castle of the Two Sisters, where a rumored "Shadow Pony" existed.
"Yes Fluttershy remember? Celestia told us she felt a strange power resonating withing the castle and asked us to look into it." I replied. Princess Celestia had sent us to investigate whatever the strange power is coming from.
"Couldn't Chara have come with us?" asked the visibly sweating Rainbow Dash. The last time we came here  She and AppleJack  were scared stiff by a "Shadow Pony" or more specifically a Princess Luna in disguise looking for a laugh. Luna told me not to long ago when I asked her about the Shadow Pony. 
"He, Frisk, Asriel, and Toriel had gone to Canterlot for a road trip" I replied. 
Chara, The once possessed murderer turned good, was a good fighter so it was sensible for RD to want him to come along.
"What's the matter Rainbow? Scared?" Joked AppleJack, Making Rainbow flinch.
"Wha...? No! I just thought.... Um...." Rainbow tried to retort but failed miserably.
Suddenly a deep but low voice echoed from the castle, it sounded like when you want to yell at someone, but you have to be quiet as you do so.
" Y O U S H O U L D N ' T H A V E C O M E H E R E."
Pinkie Pie's tail twitched as she ducked from an incredibly large ninja Shuriken. I shivered as pure magic energy pulsed from the large throwing star.
" L E A V E. N O W. B E F O R E I W I L L B E F O R C E D T O G E T.... P H Y S I C A L."
This voice seemed  reluctant on those last words.
And that's when Rainbow had to open her large mouth.
" We're not scared of you!" Rainbow cried out.
" V E R Y W E L L. Y O U ' V E F O R C E D M Y H A N D." 
"Rainbow Dash!" we all yelled at her as she flinched from our combined voices
"What?"
(Switching to Wisp's POV) 
These stupid ponies need to leave me alone!
I threw a smoke bomb in front of the six ponies from my concealed spot as i noticed one of them was an alicorn. 
Crap! I can't fight royalty!
Too late. 
POOSH! I appeared in front of them, Katana in my mouth, ready to fight as the ponies took their battle stances, only to look at me with a confused look as i put the Katana on the ground and bowed in front of the purple Alicorn. 
"ummm...... What happened to getting physical?" Asked the clearly confused alicorn.
"I cannot fight royalty, unless of course you attack first, which will result in me returning the favor tenfold" i replied, causing the princess to cringe at the last eight words. "I am called Wisp, at your service Your Majesty."
The Princess visibly blushed at my words "Y-Your Majesty? Erm..... I preferred that you called by my actual name Twilight Sparkle, Or just Twilight, and these are my friends" She replied gesturing towards the other five ponies, four of the them reluctantly waving a hoof, the white unicorn with purple hair however, was examining my ponified ninja armor. 
" Oh Darling" Darling....? "You MUST tell me where did you get your FANTASTIC wardrobe!" she was touching every last inch of my ninja garb which, if not visible already, made me VERY uncomfortable
"Pony," I said in the most intimidating voice i possibly could "If you were not a friend of the Princess,    
Y O U ' D B E D E A D R I G H T W E R E Y O U S T A N D." Sadly, even though i was being VERY serious she didn't seem to care, She was more interested in touching the team symbol on my chest then paying any mind to my warning
Thankfully, An orange Earth Pony noticed I was being serious quickly came to my rescue and said to the Unicorn "Rarity, Ah'd back off if Ah were you." tugging off the unicorn who holding on TIGHTLY to my neck responded
" Five more minutes AppleJack! I know you don't care about fashion, but I was planning on making a new fashion line with-" 
"ENOUGH" I yelled out causing a burst of energy to knock down everyone and causing Twilight to shiver violently. "Your M- I-i- mean Twilight! are you OK?"
" Yeah, yeah................ I'm fine" she said. she seemed to be thinking about something as a bouncing pink fur ball somehow got right next to me and yelled,
"Hi'mIPinkiePiewhat'syourname?Doyoulikeparties?what'syourfavoritecake?What's-"
I quickly put my hoof on her mouth causing her to shut up and look cross-eyed at my appendage.
Cute.
" You already know my name. I'm not very fond of parties, i prefer peace and quiet. I like strawberry cheesecake. Got that?"
She nodded as  a blue Pegasus with a rainbow mane approached me.
"How good of a fighter are you?"  She asked 
" Better than you, And it's pretty obvious" i replied. not even exaggerating, i can actually tell and i could knock her down three seconds flat,
"Oh Really? Prove it." 
I shrugged and prepared a quick spell....
One...... 
Energy builded up as i took a battle stance 
Two.......
" PK Spirit α!"
A hot burst of energy blasted out as the Pegasus was quickly knocked down.
Three. I win.
She quickly got up as she tried hard to make look as if it hadn't hurt. She failed
"Heh heh.... Not bad. Name's Rainbow Dash" She shook my hoof as she said that. Did i gain her respect just by casting a spell? eh whatever, i need help to find Serena, Emma, Ja'mari and....... and....... huh, can't remember......... I swore there were five of us.......oh well.
"How'd you do that? you're clearly not a unicorn." asked the Princess as which i quickly replied,
"I'm not exactly a pony either. I'll explain later, if you agree to take me to Princesses Celestia and Luna."
"Well were going to take you whether ya wanted to or not." Replied AppleJack wait let me check if her name actually is that....
" Before we go i want to make sure i know everything so....."
"Your Majesty, Princess Twilight Sparkle."
"Just Twilight please" she replied as she clearly blushed to be called that.
"AppleJack"
"Yep"
"Pinkie Pie"
" Here!" Quickly replied the ever-bouncing pony
"Rainbow Dash."
"The one and only!" Someone's full of themselves.
" Rarity...... don't ever touch me like that again."
"Sorry Darling, i was just so excited seeing as you were friendly and you had an AMAZING outfit and-"
"OK, OK, i get the gist. And you are....?" I glanced at the the yellow Pegasus hiding behind a tree. she eeped as she realized I had already seen her and quietly replied
"Fluttershy" Her voice was somehow softer than mine.
"Excuse me?"
"Fluttershy" Somehow her name made a ton of sense.
"Huh, Fluttershy, nice name. Anyhow, I'm tired of sleeping in an abandoned castle so could we please move on before it gets dark?" i gestured towards the sun, still brightly shining in the sky, well not for long if we don't move on. 
"Right! Mission accomplished! We need to get to Ponyville real quick so i can notify the princess." Twilight mentioned and started walking into the forest but not before stopping to have some internal dialogue.  
I always notice these types so i quickly said "Twilight you OK?"
"Huh? Yeah, yeah i'm fine. Come on!" She replied as she ran into the Everfree. If only i noticed the black tendrils approaching us from behind I could've stopped  the attack before it began.
************************************************************************************************
"wait so you're a GHOST!?!?!?!" Asked Rainbow shocked as I finally finished telling them how i got here, how i found the Castle of the Two Sisters, how I needed help to find my friends, and how i learned everything i needed to know (and more importantly how to fight in my new pony form)  about pony kind.
"Half-Ghost technically speaking" I corrected " also don't call me a ghost. I like being called a spirit better"
"Why? I mean you don't have to tell us if you don't want to......" Asked Fluttershy being as polite as possible.
"Because being called a ghost bothers me Okay? I don't like to talk about it."
"How did you die?" Asked Pinkie Pie
I stopped dead in my tracks making obvious to the others that she had touched a nerve. Except for Pinkie. Go Figure
I quietly sighed and turned around facing Pinkie and showing to her i had teared up a bit. The only other person i had told this too...... I couldn't remember their name.
" Many years ago in my own dimension....."
(flashback time people! get your popcorn and enjoy the show!)
 I was a powerful ninja and had trained alongside my father and my best-est friend Sophia. We trained under the watchful eye of my father. One day Nightmare the king of shadows led his army of Soulless, creatures made of despair and darkness. They attacked my village, and my father tried to help protect the villagers. He was mortally wounded and no matter what i did he could not have been healed. Before his death, he revealed to us a secret he was supposed to take to his grave, Me and Sophia had powerful Light Magic capable of defeating Nightmare and his Soulless. He died that day. Sophia and I were determined to defeat Nightmare and we went to his Shadow Castle to defeat him. Blade met Blade! Magic countered Magic! Sophia and i were winning the fight until  Nightmare used my own DESPAIR against me. He created a hallucination of my father in order to distract me, and attempted to deal the final blow.......
"And that's how you died!" Pinkie assumed
"Shh!" Rarity Exclaimed her makeup running down her face along with her tears " Please continue Wisp Darling" 
"Ahem!"
.........and Sophia took the attack. I had lost two people valuable to me that day. My SOUL felt as though it was about to burst as Sophia uttered her last words.
"I love.............. you...........  Charles........"
"I love you too! That's why it can't end like this!"
"G o o d b y e    C h a r l e s"
Her SOUL appeared before me, as it faded away, not shattering, just disappeared, never to be seen again. I Did not let her death be in vain. Nightmare and I fought with everything we had, until Nightmare was successfully slain, swearing that his descendant would be out for revenge. I walked away hoping to prepare a funeral for my father, Sophia, and all the dead villagers. Only to have be impaled by Nightmares blade. 
"I warned you before we fought Charlie........ Y O U ' D B E D E A D R I G H T W E R E Y O U S T A N D." 
However my determination refused to let me die, allowing me to come back many years later, with a white soul and the duty to protect someone. Sadly, I somehow forgot who that was. But whoever they were, they began a team with three of their friends and me. He called us the Guardians Of Hope. We worked to fill people with HOPE and vanquish any DESPAIR that stood in our way. All the while i searched for Sophia's spirit, But it was never found........ 
" and to this day i'm still looking for her."
"That is awesome!" Exclaimed Rainbow. Everyone stared at her " I mean not the part about you losing your friend and dying!" She quickly explained "The part were your a ninja with really strong Magic! So your some kind of Ninja Pony!"
"'Ninja Pony' huh. Has a nice ring to it." i replied
Twilight notepad out, quickly asked " so what exactly is a soulless?" 
Before i could reply i noticed a A shadowy creature appear behind Twilight and i pulled out my Katana and prepared to take a swing
"Umm..... Wisp???" She asked fear rising in her voice 
"Duck!" I cried out attacking the creature. as i did so, i noticed a white gem on the creatures chest......
In the shape of a broken heart.
"Looks like your about to find out! Get behind me!" 
Two more Soulless appeared next to it each one baring their fangs
"Come at me!"
