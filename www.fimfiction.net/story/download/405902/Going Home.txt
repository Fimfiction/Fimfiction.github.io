The tentacled being known as Ach'rd'oa shifted in her cell, shifting in her bindings she attempted to return to her slumber, but that which awoke her continued.

"Those Damn Ponies, When I escape again..." 

"You'll What?"  Ach'rd'oa shouted.

She rose from her bed and stalked to edge of her bindings, her tall, lithe frame shaking in rage.  Again she bellowed at the cell next to her.

"The always win, the Ponies always win!!!!!  What will happen is you will break free and then be sent back here or destroyed.  Sombra, You, The Storm King, Me, hell, they reformed Discord.  So, Tirek, do us all a favor and shut the fuck up!!!!!!  You stupid spoiled little child.  Oh, my brother and father betrayed me, blech.  Truth is you are a mad dog that no one has had the kindness to put out of it's misery.  Because for some Idiotic reason the Ponies think any one can be redeemed." 

Retreating back to her bed she sat, bringing her clawed hands to her head, she tried to fight the oncoming migraine.  Unable to stop the words, she continued.

"I have lost my entire race, which is not the same as destroying it, you pompous shit!  I had loved ones, compatriots.  Those that I cared for and protected.  All of them gone and I am the last.  I am the last because I can birth no more of my kind.  The rest were exterminated to a one because we wouldn't play nice with the ponies, because we treated them like just another lesser race.  We used them for labor, pleasure, and food, just like all the others The Illithids encountered.  What do the Ponies do?  They send Celestia and Luna, who upon seeing our city and all we have wrought, destroy our entire civilization in one night.  I tried to organize those that where left, those that could flee.  But they hunted us all down and when I was the last they caught me.  They discovered that I had not the capability to spawn more of my kind and locked me down here.  So that in time I would see the error of my ways."

"So, what?  I am supposed to give friendship a try, give into their disgusting ways?"  Tireck Growled.

"No Dipshit, You're supposed to shut up and let the rest of us deal with our misery in PEACE!!!!!  I no longer have any wish to conquer, nor do I have a wish to go and make friends.  I would however, like to sit in my mother's chair, to walk the streets of the dreaming city once more.  To see the remains of the birthing pool where my brothers emerged.  To just once, before I sink into the dreamless sleep of my kind breathe of the night air, not whatever it is we get down here.  I wish to go home."  Ach'rd'oa hung her head and silence reigned, Tireck at last silenced.

A click was heard, loud in the silence, wards deactivating, one after another, the chains that peirced her flesh turning to dust.  Healing energy flowed into her, closing the wounds that she had accumulated over her long imprisonment.  Gasping for air she looked to the door as it easily swung open.  She rose and walked out the door.

Celestia and Luna sat at breakfast.  Luna tired after a long night and Celestia readying herself for the labors of the day.  A Red flash of light momentarily blind the sisters and, as they opened her eyes they beheld a letter upon the table.  It was written in blood and was upon a parchment made of skin, both Princesses stared at each other.  Taking it in her magic, Luna began to read aloud.

To Princess Celesia, Princess of the Sun, Lady of the Day
To Princess Luna, Princess of The Moon, Lady of the Night
To Princess Twilight, Princess of Friendship, Lady of Ponyville

"This is to certify on this day Tuesday of 3500 ANM in the month of January, on the 8th day that prisoner# 00023, named Ach'rd"oa, has been deemed worthy of parole, as she is no longer a threat to any of the free thinking and free willed beings of Equestria and is subject to the rights, privileges, and responsibilities therein, both lawful and implied.  She is to be allowed passage back to the Dreaming City, known as Ry'll'Ch where ownership of such is to be returned to her.  What she does next will determine her future for fair or foul.  Let all be blessed upon hearing these words and rejoice that one that has been lost for so long has begun to find their way.
Your Servant Unceasing,
Tarturus"

Finishing the letter, Luna asked.  "Did you know that Tarturus could...." 

"No Sister, I did'nt"  Came Celestia's reply.

"Oh, Ach'rd'oa is an Illithid correct?"

"Half Illithid, sister, she cannot produce more like her."

"Ah, So how are we to deal with this?"

"We sit and wait, if she is indeed no longer a threat then we leave her be."

"And If not?"

"Then, younger sister mine, we will find out what barbecued Callamari tastes like."

The two sisters lapsed back into a comfortable silence.  The breakfast forgotten, each to their own thoughts and preperations.  In the end they bid each other farewell and Luna went to rest as Celestia went to begin the day.
In their haste, both failed to ask one thing, WWPTSD?

Ach'rd'oa left the cavern that she had been lead to and walked out into the sunlight, before sat her home, a vast sprawling ruin, the doors sealed to prevent entry.  She walked forward and touched a clawed hand where the doors meet and one by one the doors swung open.  Feeling the City awaken, she smiled for the first time in over a century, the warmth of Ry'll'ch's greeting filling her with joy

"It is good to be home, now to work, to task."

Once more she entered into the city of her birth as the Doors closed behind her, she was free.

Groggily raising her head, Twilight crawled her way from the tangled mess of blankets her bed had become. Slinking down the stairs, she followed the smell of beautiful nectar that was her morning cup of coffee. Staggering blindly into the kitchen, she kissed Rainbow dash, poured herself a cup of the black viscous tar that was her special blend, drank the cup like a shot glass, poured herself another cup.  Then, glancing around her kitchen she spotted her friends, waking fully she smiled. 

“Hey guys, what’s up?”  Twilight smiled at her friends, "And why is Rainbow on the floor?"

“Y’all kissed Dash again.”

“What?  No I didn’t.”  Then she continued thoughtfully, "I've never kissed Rainbow Dash, no matter what my Romantic Fanfiction says."

"What was that?" Applejack asked

"Huh? Nothing."  Twilight replied.

Her friends just shook their heads at Twilight, Rainbow still recovering her powers of thought from the Alicorn powered kiss she had just received. 

“Not that I’m not glad to see you girls, but why are you six here?”  Twilight asked, a thoughtful look appeared on her face, 

“This isn’t another intervention is it?”

Spike spoke up first, “No, we all wanted to know about the ancient city in the Everfree that suddenly appeared over night.  We thought you might have some ideas.”

"Yeah! I have to know if I have a Congratulations on reawakening your Blasphemous City of Terror party to plan and what insanity inducing aberration of reality it's for.  I mean do you know what'll happen if I use the oysters meant for Cthullu if the party wa meant for Yog-Soth, not to mention what a drama queen Nylarhotep can be if something goes wrong.  I mean, honestly Twilight, a little notification would have been nice." Pinkie interjected.

“City what city?  Listen if this is about my coffee consumption, I have it down to three pots a day, which we all agreed was acceptable for an Alicorn of my age and body weight.”

“Quite Darling, even though you did work out how to triple the potency in each pot, making your personal brew the equivalent of sludge, but again, not why we are here. Like dear Spikey Wikey said, a city revealed itself after you had passed out from your five day book binge. We wanted to know if you'd heard anything from the Princesses about this.”

“No, I’m pretty sure they would have notified me of that.”  The Purple Princess got another thoughtful look, “So this intervention is about my book bingeing, huh?  Well I'll have you know I made sure to feed Owlicious and gave Spike access to the grocery money.  Also I wore the horn inhibitor with the 5 digit randomized code lock so that I wouldn’t cast anything without being able to mathematically calculate the exact sequence of randomization.”

“Owlicious is over at my house and the grocery money only had 5 bits in it.  Spike stayed with Rarity after the second day.” Fluttershy interjected.  “But we really are telling the truth about the city.  I found out about it when a manticore that had lived there was complaining about getting evicted.  Oh, and if you don't mind that is, can you send Phil back home?"

Twilight looked confused, "Phil?"

Her friends nodded eerily in unison, then said simultaneously, in the same deep voice, "Yeah, if you wouldn't mind, in this dimension I can only exist in the minds of these six mares and this young drake.  But if it will help move things along, a letter did come for you, from a Mr. Tartarus.  I had Spike place it on your desk, I didn't want to interrupt your obsessive spree of Insanity.  So, not that this is not fun and all, but I really would like to get back to my own family.  So can you just banish me and let us all exit this bad gag that has run to long."

Twilight pursed her lips, "Fine, Klaatu, Barada, Necktie,"  She intoned

"Yeah, you seem to have gotten the last one wrong."  Phil replied.

Twilight took another sip of her coffee, clearing her throat she said, in a slow, calm, quiet voice. "If you do not leave my friend's minds this very instant, then retreat back to wherever it is I called you from, I will yank your essence out of them and feed said essence through my coffee maker to add extra kick to the next pot."

Twilight watched as smoke poured out of her friends and fled screaming up the stairs towards whatever circle she had called 'Phil' out of, a moment later she felt the surge of an interdemensional gateway opening and shutting extremely quickly.

Twilight smiled, "Still got it."

She then picked up her coffee cup, kissed Rainbow Dash, again, poured herself another cup and retreated to her desk.  Quickly reading the letter she yelled to her still rising friends.  "Hey guys, I found our next Friendship Adventure."

Running over to them, she waited as they got to there feet, then noticed that one of her friends was still on the floor.

"Hey, Guys?  What happened to Rainbow Dash?"

The Purple Book horse was puzzled that all her friends, minus Rainbow, face palmed in unison.

Back in Cantorlot, Princess Celestia, sat tending to the day court.  All throughout her duties she felt like she had forgotten something.  The Noble before her was twattling on about some inane thing she was going to politely say no to, completely unaware that his Princess wasn't paying him the slightest bit of attention.

"What am I missing?"  Celestia thought.  "It's such a horrible feeling not to remember.  Let me retrace my steps, I woke up, raised the sun, Luna set the moon.  We retreated to breakfast.  Tartarus sent us a letter, hmmmmm.  Something about that letter.  Something I am forgetting, Hmmmmmmm."

A clamoring was heard at the Day Court door, and in rushed Luna, still in her Pajamas, her panicked look evident upon her face.  "Sister, there was another name on that letter!" 

The Princess of the Day, paused, why would there be another name on the letter?  Cadance was a princess of a lesser kingdom, so it wouldn't have been addressed to her.  In fact the only Princess that might have gotten...... the......... letter...... was... "HOLY FUCK SHIT CRAP SUCK.  PRINCESS TWILIGHT SPARKLE GOT THE SAME LETTER!!!!!"
