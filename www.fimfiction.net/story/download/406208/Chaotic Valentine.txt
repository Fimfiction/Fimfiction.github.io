Silent.

That was the way she liked it.

After a long week of dealing with problems, it was nice to just relax with a good book.

She groaned just thinking about the last few days.

First she had a talk with the school fillies on the importance of friendship, then a MAJOR Spring clean up of her castle. Polishing every inch of the inside and out. Over seeing that year's winter wrap up. A family dinner, and agreeing to watch her niece for a bit. Two friendship problems, a sleep over, and FINALLY a diplomatic meeting in Canterlot with Princess Celestia and Luna.

It seemed she could finally relax without being interrupted as Spike agreed to help Rarity and Fluttershy with a pet fashion line, Rainbow was doing Wonderbolt training, and Pinkie was helping A.J. plan Big Mac's birthday. And she wasn't expecting any visitors.

Yes. It was a quiet night. 

Too bad she didn't suspect a chaotic interruption.

"Why..Hello there my dear little Starbutt! How are you tonight?"

She groaned before face-hooving herself.

Of course. Of course! He would show up after a long week of stressful events and planning.

"What do you want, Discord?" She turned around and came face to face with the smiling chesire grin of the chaotic being.
The spirit of chaos and disharmony himself was floating leisurely above her. He twisted around much like a serpent until he was in the position that resembled somepony laying on their stomach.....except he was in the air.

The mitchmatched creature smiled wider. "I got bored, and seeing as everypony else is busy as the moment except you, I figured......Why not drop by and see how.....glad you'd be to see a friend?"

"........*sigh* It's nice to see you too, Discord. But, did you really have to show up now? I wasn't prepared for any visits right now." 

"Well....you might as well get used to this sort of thing. Considering both of us suffer from immortal-itise. Or did you forget about your meeting with the ambassador?"

".......How could you have possibly known about that?!"

How could he, indeed. Yesterday's diplomatic meeting.......hadn't been the worst. But it most certainly wasn't the best.
It turns out a King from a kingdom from the lands up North, had come all the way to the land of Equestria to discuss a possible trading partnership or alliance. They settled for an alliance, but then the suggestion of a marriage between his son and one of the princesses to unite their kingdoms came up.  It turned out where he was from, it was quite common to seal important deals such as this with a marriage.

Both Princess Celestia and Luna could use the argument of being too old and explained that they had already been married at least four times each, and since Cadence was already married......She had to very politely and forcefully turn down his.......nine suggestions to her. But, on his tenth try, she nearly made an outburst.

"But, you will probably never know what marriage would be like anyway. Why not experience it ounce before your immortality and stubbornness makes you into an old maid mare?"

She wanted to scream, 'What the buck is wrong with you?! I am perfectly capable of finding a colt friend by myself! In MY own time!'

Celestia had placed a wing around her and sternly told him it was rude to force others into something  and that no meant no.

And that was it.

He waved his lion paw. "I'm the spirit of chaos and disharmony. Time is no problem for me."

".......*sigh* What's even the point of this talk?"

"To let you know that you're not the only immortal to be faced with the problem of a spouse."
She raised an eyebrow at this. "YOU have been pressured by a king to marry his son?"

"No. What I meant was that we all have different versions of that problem. With a spouse and immortality."

"........I don't follow you."

"Take Sun and Moonbutt for example. They've already been married......Oh, I don't know.....three or four times each and have stopped because of their age and they can't take it anymore. And your niece is going to go through the same thing one day as well as Cadence.......We all have that problem, Twilight. Even if it's different versions of it."

".........And you?"

"Me? Well........I had one crush when I was really young.....but it didn't last long. But, I am currently infatuated with another mare."

"........." She stood up to place a hoof on his shoulder. "Discord........I'm sorry to tell you this......but Fluttershy is already with somepony else."

"......." He stared at her. "......Pffffft. AHAHAHAHAHAHA!! *gasp* HAHAHAHA!!"

She was quite taken aback from his sudden outburst.

"My dear.......I'm afraid you have the wrong mare."

"......But.....I thought...."

"Fluttershy would be anyone's first guest.....but she will never be more than a dear friend to me. But, I am going to keep a VERY close eye on that Iron Will fellow she's with."

"......Then who? Pinkie Pie?"

"Goodness. No. That mare is too hyper. Even for me."

''.......Trixie?," she asked trying to think of any mares that could be that close to him.
"Friend zone."

"Rarity?"

"Already with Fancy Overalls."

"You mean Fancy Pants."

"Yes. Him."

"......Rainbow?"

"Already with Soarin, and A.J. isn't interested in a relationship. And as I've stated before, Tia and Moony are done with any hubbies. "

"Then that doesn't leave anypony left."

He put both hands under his chin and gave her a half lidded look. "Really, Ms. Sparkle? Everybody?"

"Well, of course. It's none of our friends or the princesses-"

"Who said it wasn't a princess?" He raised an eyebrow.

"But, you said-"

"I know what I said. I said I wasn't interested in the sisters, and obviously your niece and Cadence aren't an option. Too young and already married." 

"Then who could you possibly.....be....talking.....about?"
She slowly met his gaze......and he smiled wider if that was even possible. She raised a hoof to point at herself.

"Me?"

"Ding, ding, ding! Congratulations! You won the 'I take too long to realize things' award!"
She decided to ignore his obnoxious shout. "Why?" 
"You challenge me. Surprise me. You have magical abilities that rival the other princesses and Star Swirl himself. You surprise me every time I try to be.......playful."

She rolled her eyes.

''You even saved my life ounce. Despite the awful things I did. Fluttershy is my friend, but even she would've never gave up all that magic just to save me and her friends. She would've most likely ran and went into hiding to save the Princesses' magic." 

".......And what makes you think I would even consider being with you? Not that I'm trying to be rude."
"Oh, come now. You can't tell me that you aren't even the bit curious about me. A chaotic being that's lived for centuries and the only surviving member of my kind. Not to mention all those lessons you would've never learnt without me."

''......"

She hated to admit it, but he did have a point. She had thought of those things a couple of times, but never really thought he would he'd actually tell her.

"Besides.....having a spouse that would keep me entertained, be my friend, and most of all....with be with me to the end of time. Literally.....That's a lucky find immortals rarely run into."

".......Discord.....I..."

"One chance."

"One chance. That's all I ask for. If it doesn't work out, no harm done. We'll still be friends and I'll never bother you with it again."

"When?"

"Tomorrow is Hearts and Hooves Day. Seems like a decent time. Plus, it might keep Blue Blood and the rest of those young nobles away."

"Uuuuh....Don't remind me."

"Then it's a date, I presume."

"......Ok. A date. It beats being stuck without anything to do. And who knows? It might be interesting."
"Oh, good. I'm going to fly all over Canterlot and Ponyville and shout that you'll be dating an old goat more than twice your age tomorrow before retiring tonight. That way, everypony knows you'll be busy tomorrow. Chao." With a snap of his eagle claw, he vanished.

"Wait! WHAT?!"

But he was already gone.

"DISCOOOORD!!"
