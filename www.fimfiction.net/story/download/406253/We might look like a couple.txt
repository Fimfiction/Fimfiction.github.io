Chapter one of "We might look like a couple."
Twilight is surprised
Written by Yumyums23

One day Twilight Sparkle walked around in a big field, full of delicious green grass. Fluttershy then ran up next to her.

"Twilight, I have a problem!" she cried, tears streaking down her face like waterfalls. Now Twilight was worried.

"What's wrong?" Twilight asked, worried about her friend. She licked her friend's hair trying to calm her down, she liked it because it tasted like silly string.

"I want to go have dinner with you at a fancy restaurant," The pegasus told her "But ponies might think we're a couple!" 

Now Twilight was confused.

"Wait!" she yelled, a hoof raised, "I thought we were a couple." 

A few minutes of silence passed by as Fluttershy thought over what her friend had just said.

"I am so sorry that you thought that." the pinked haired pony apologized, licking her own hair in sorrow. "It's all my-"

"No!" Twilight interjected, "It's not your fault, I'm the one that thought we were a couple!"

Another moment of silence passed by, and they were pretty sure they were both thinking the same thing.

"You didn't tell anyone, did you?" Fluttershy asked, breaking the silence.

"Yes." the lavender unicorn sighed "Spike and the princesses."

Fluttershy furrowed her eyebrows.

"And who did they tell?"

"The entire town."

"Great."

Silence filled the room.

"So." Twilight said to Fluttershy "You wanna go on a date?"

Chapter two of "We might look like a couple."
Fluttershy is not happy
Written by Yumyums23

Twilight and Fluttershy decided to go on a date but to do it as friends.

They walked back into town and into Twilight's rock candy castle to plan the date.

They ran inside and found the entire town throwing a party for them.

"Welcome to the party for you and Flutters becoming lovers!" Pinkie poo yelled, catching the purple lavender unicorn by surprise.

"No no no." Fluttershy squeaked as loud as she could. (which wasn't that loud, but still) "Me and Twilight Jenkins Butterbutt Sparkle are not a couple!"

The crowd did not listen though.

Discord then appeared out of nowhere and made the most annoying announcement, or at least to Twilight it was annoying.

"I have decided to be evil again!" he yelled in a voice that just made the unicorn want to spit. "If Fluttershy won't stay loyal to me, I guess I have to!"

The butter coated mare yelped in surprise and ran up to him.

"Discord no!" She screamed "Twilight and I are not together, you and I are!"

She then realized that he was gone off into the sunset, eating his butt flavored tootsie rolls.

The butter slice crawled up into a ball and cried because she did not know what else to do.

"I got an idea!" Twilight yelled from behind her. "How about we kiss?"

"NO!" Fluttershy yelled in an almost demonic voice "We are NOT a couple, so we shall NOT kiss!"

Twilight had tears in her eyes as she walked up to Fluttershy...

And she took off a costume, revealing that she was not Twilight, but a pig with wings.'

Fluttershy screamed as loud as she could, hoping she could get out of this nightmare, but sadly it was not a dream.

Princess Luna then walked up to them and shoved some roses in their faces.

"Who's the happy couple?"

Chapter three of "We might look like a couple."
Discord is hurt
Written by Yumyums23

Discord paced back and forth in his home of many stairs, wondering why he said he would turn evil. 

He knew he would never have the guts to actually betray Fluttershy...

Even though he had before.

Tears ran down his face as he fell to the floor, not having any motivation to stand.

Not even cotton candy could make him happy right now.

Not even dogs licking peanut butter.

Not even Twilight running away from a flying quesadilla...

All that would make him happy right now, is seeing his Fluttershy.

But he couldn't, not after what he had said.

Poonkie pie feels threatened (for some reason)
Written by Yumyums23

Pellet poo felt very offended, but she did not know why.

"I know why, you keep spelling my name wrong!" Pinky perplex screamed. She stood inside of her bathroom, angry that Fluttershy and Twilight left her party. 

And that the heart of the party, Discord, left as well. She sat on the toilet, the seat down, of course, thinking about her situation.

"What can I do to save this party?" the pink pony asked herself. 

At the end she decided to just sleep in the bathtub, deciding that the party could be better when out of her hands. She looked next to her as she tried to go to sleep and saw Gummy staring at her.

"Why are you just giving up like this Pinkie Pie?" he asked the pony, "That isn't the Pinkie Pie I know."

But of course, he wasn't actually using his mouth to talk. Gummy said all of that just using body language.

"Your right Gummy." Pookie Pie said, jumping out of the bathtub.

Sadly, as she jumped out she tripped on the side of the bathtub and hit her head super hard on the ground.

Gummy poked her.

She didn't respond.

"I said all of that encouraging stuff for nothing..." Gummy thought angrily to himself. He then walked out the door, hoping he could get someones attention.

The final chapter of "We might look like a couple."
Stomach ache
Written by Yumyums23

As Gummy walked out of the door he spotted the yummy snacks. He started speed walking towards them, completely forgetting about Ponkie Pie.

He made friends with some other animals in the building, and he ate until his stomach hurt so much he thought he was on fire.

His friend, Mr. Rat abandoned him right when he fell over from the pain. Then, he remembered his owner and her little fall in the bathroom.

He cried and cried but nobody would listen to him.

"I think Gummy's crying" a nearby mare mentioned, scratching her chin, "You think we should ask what's wrong?"

"Nah." Her sister replied, "He's probably just angry that there are not enough snacks for his gigantic belly."

The first mare decided that they would not check on him, that was a mistake.

As they walked away from the sobbing alligator, they failed to notice the blood leaking out from underneath the bathroom door.
